# Lambda Expressions Demo

## Notes

1. Use the following command to download and execute a shell script that retrieves
   the starter code for this tutorial and places it into a subdirectory
   called `cs1302-demos-lambdas`:

   ```
   ** NEED NEW LINK**
   $ curl -s -L https://git.io/Jv0QP | bash
   ```

1. Discuss the objectives of the demo and compile the starter code with the script. This is a
   good opportunity to review scripting.
